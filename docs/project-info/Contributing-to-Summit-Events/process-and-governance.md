# Getting Setup to Contribute
**Please read carefully to ensure any contributions made to the Summit Events Repo happens smoothly and as quickly as possible**

When contributing to the [Summit Events Repository](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App), we are encouraging you utilize one of the following two tools:

1. [CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started.html#work-on-an-existing-cumulusci-project)

2. [Metecho](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/project-info/Contributing-to-Summit-Events/metecho/) 

We encourage the community to contribute with their thoughts and ideas, whether they are a developer, admin or a user.  For those that are a User or Admin and not comfortable with Salesforce CLI, we encourage you to connect with us below or in the [Trailblazer Community](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kHi2SAE?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC).

## Process and Governance

Salesforce is an Open-Source Community Application. While Open-Source, we try to maximize accessibility by making it a managed package.  When contributing to Summit Events, we follow a governance process to ensure it meets all standards of the application, salesforce security and functionality.

1. Start by creating a new branch from the main branch on the [Summit Events Repo](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App). Metecho will do this automatically. Salesforce CLI users will need to do this in Github or Github Desktop.
2. Make the appropriate edits and changes in your scratch org.
3. Commit your changes to your branch.
4. Have your changes reviewed by a peer, utilizing the same tool you used to create the scratch org.
5. Once the peer review is complete, create a pull request.
6. Give as much detail as possible and link any issues you may have completed.
7. The pull request will be reviewed by the Project Leadership team.  They will ask questions about the update and may bring the update/enhancement/changes to the monthly team meetings for discussion.
