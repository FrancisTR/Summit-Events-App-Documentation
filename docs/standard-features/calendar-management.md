# Calendar Management

Once Summit Events is installed many organizations want to display their event calendar on their website so the public can see the events they are offering. Here is an example of what the event calendar looks like on a web page - you can accomplish the same thing by following the instructions below.
Salesforce Administrator Steps:
1.	Create a CORS record in Salesforce. This allows the calendar code to run in the web browser to communicate with Salesforce on your web domain.
•	Go to Setup -> Security ->CORS.
•	Click “New”
•	Enter the "Original URL Pattern" value for your domain - **for example, "https://*.crown.edu"**
