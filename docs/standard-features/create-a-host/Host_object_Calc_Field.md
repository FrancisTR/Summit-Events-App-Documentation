# Create Calculated Field on Host Object #

1. From Setup, open the Object Manager and search for the Summit Events Host object.
2. In the left sidebar, click Fields & Relationships.
3. Click New.
4. Select Formula and click Next.
5. In Field Label, give the field a name.  For example: Search Display Name. When you click out of the field label, the API name will automatically be created for you.
6. Select the Text as the type of data you expect your formula to return.
7. Click Next. Youâ€™ve arrived at the formula editor!
8. Click on the Advanced tab and Use the The Insert Field button to open a menu that allows you to select fields to use in your formula. Inserting from this menu automatically generates the correct syntax for accessing fields. The feilds you include here will depend upon how you are using Hosts.

Example calculation to display the host first and last name feilds along with the event instance name and date:<br><br>
Contact__r.LastName + ' '+ Contact__r.FirstName + '-'+   Event_Instance__r.Instance_Title__c  +'-'+ TEXT(MONTH(Event_Instance__r.Instance_Start_Date__c)) + '/'+
TEXT(DAY(Event_Instance__r.Instance_Start_Date__c))+'/'+
TEXT(YEAR(Event_Instance__r.Instance_Start_Date__c))
