3. Edit the registrant's Summit Event Appointment page and use the lookup to select the desired Host.  <br>
*Tip: The host lookup feild, returns hosts regardless of instance.  To make it easier to find the correct host, you can [create a calculated field on the Host object](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/summit-events-app-documentation/blob/main/docs/standard-features/SE_Hosts_Feature/Host_object_Calc_Field.md) to display more information in the lookup field.*
