# Private Events Overview

The Private Event feature blocks the event instance from appearing on event lists/calendars. You have two options when using the feature:

1. If all the event instances will be private, check the Private Event checkbox at the Event Level in the Additonal Configuration section as shown in the following screen shot:

2. If some event instances will be private, do not check the Private Event checkbox at the Event Level in the Additonal Configuration section and instead toggle the Private Instance checkbox at the Event Instance level as shown in the following screen shot:
