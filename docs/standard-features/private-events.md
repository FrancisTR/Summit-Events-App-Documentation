# Private Events Overview

Creating a Private Event blocks it from appearing on event lists/calendars. This allows for control over access to the event registration link since anyone with the link can register for the event. You can make the event private at both the Event and Event Instance levels, but setting it as private at the Event level overrides the Event Instance privacy setting.

To create a Private Event, go to the Summit Events tab and select New.
<br>**Remember that you can make the event private on this page, but making the Event private will override subsequent Event instances' privacy settings.*
