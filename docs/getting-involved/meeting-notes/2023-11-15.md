## Updates
* Bug that gave access to all profiles.  Thad fixed and republished on Metadeploy
* Sprint last week - worked on getting examples so that we can add them to the install process.  The examples are now in Metecho.  Trying to get the option to choose if want example data into meta deploy so that they could choose to add at time of install if so desired.  Ryan walked us through some of the examples they created.
* Pushed a bug release just after sprint.
* Ryan spoke about SEA at nonprofit dreamin and did a fantastic job.  There seemed to be a lot of interest.  

## Issues
* Marina showed us a bug that when change time to 7pm it seems to kick date to next day.  Ryan could not immediately reproduce.  Ryan recommended trying to update the picklist value that Marina added.
* Thad will comment on bug Donna submitted to say why it is happening and why we don't address so can be added to known issues.
* Donna will put a sentance about additional permission set for SEA Admin and folks can review to see if appropriate.
* After holidays or the first of the year, we can setup another working day.
