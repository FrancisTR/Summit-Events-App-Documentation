# Summit Events Registrations
The Summit Events Registration object captures the information the registrant input while registering.


## Smaller title
Once a registrant registers for an event instance, a record will be automatically created in the Summit Event Registration object. Usually, you do not need to manually create an event registration. After the registration is created by the system, you can view and edit the details of the registration. Instead of explaining the steps to creating an event registration, this object will explain how we can view and edit the event registration after it has been created.

We can view the event registrations of a specific event instance or an event. On the Event Instance page, hover the cursor over to the “Summit Event Registrations” on the top and a lookup list of all registrations for the event instance will show up. You can also scroll down to the “Summit Event Registrations”, which is usually the first section after all the event instance information.

You can also view the registrations similarly on the Event page.
