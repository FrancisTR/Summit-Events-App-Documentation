3. Review the recently or exisiting event record
4. Go to the Field Labels

**Workaround**
1. Import the default fields via dataloader or Import Wizard with a Event Records.
2. [Summit.Events.Default.Field.Labels.csv template](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/summit-events-app-documentation/files/8847091/Summit.Events.Default.Field.Labels.csv)
