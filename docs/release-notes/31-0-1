## Important Items and Upgrade Action Steps
Below are important items to note prior to upgrading to 0.30.0.1 as well as post installation.

### Guest User Access Reminder (This was also mentioned in the 0.29.0.1 Release Notes)

There were several updates in the previous updates impacting the Summit Event Registant Permission Set and access needed for the Guest User. Below outlines what access is needed to avoid disruption as well as a new standard for Summit Evnets App and how to configure and manage Guest User Access.
- The Guest User is required to have READ access to the Account Object. No additional field access necessary.
  - A lookup to the Account Object on the Summit Event Record prompted this update.  
- It is recommended and encouraged that [upon installation or prior to upgrading](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/Getting-Started/Installing/#creating-a-custom-permission-set-for-the-guest-user), you create a custom permission set, granting READ access to the Account Object and add that to the Guest User. While previous documentation encourages cloning the Guest Permission set, weâ€™re adjusting those instructions to create a custom permission set (not clone) in addition tothe Guest User having the packaged permission set (Summit Event Registrant). This will allow for a more seamless upgrade process while then allow you to manage your own customization on a single permission set. 
  - While in the code base, the Summit Event Registrant has READ access to the Account object. Upon install we found that the permission was removed, likely due to Salesforce Security protocols being enforced.

## Functional Features, Updates and Bug Fixes
### Long Text Fields for Picklist Options (resolved [#495](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/495) and [#446](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/446))
- When utilizing Additional Questions (on the Summit Events object) and Custom Questions, when the field type is picklist, users were limmited to a picklist that consisted of 255 character.  At times, a Lookup or Lookup Picklist isn't a viable option, so users opted to add their values to the picklist option fields. With this update additional LONG TEXT fields were added to extend the amount of characters that can be utilized in the additional and custom question picklists. Current users do not need to migrate their picklist values while still leveraging the new long text field.  

### Guest Registration Screen Confirming input validation (resolved [#514](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/514)
- When utilizing Guest Registration, a user may enter information and miss hitting the button to formally add their guest.  While in the last release, this is [highlighted to the registrant ](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/502), the registrant may actually want to move forward without adding what they type. Previously a user would have to delete all felds, now the registrant is provided with a pop-up asking if they really want to move forward without submitting what they entered.
