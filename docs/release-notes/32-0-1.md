## Important Items and Upgrade Action Steps
Below are important items to note prior to upgrading to 0.31.0.1 as well as post installation.

### Guest User Access Reminder (This was also mentioned in the [0.29.0.1](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/release-notes/0-29-0-1/) Release Notes)

- Please read the recommendation around [creating a custom permissions set](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/Getting-Started/Installing/#creating-a-custom-permission-set-for-the-guest-user). 
  
### Page Layouts and Picklists to Update Post Installation/Upgrade
The following Lightning Layouts and Page Layouts need to be updated to expose new fields leveraging some new functionality/updates. Below we're sharing the API name, which has a matching label:

* No changes were made to the page layouts in this release.

## Known Issues

If you experience any issues, please post in the Trailblazer Community should you be experiencing any issues with this release.

* When adding the Visualforce Component to an Experience Cloud site and selecting "Summit Events", The full calendar display, but seems to have Javascript or CSS issues. The way it's presenting in the builder and in preview mode appear as though the calendar isn't rendering appropriately.  While it appears this way in those views, once the site is published and the calendar is accessible to the end user, it displays as expected. The end goal of displaying the calendar is met, but the admin experience is different.

## Functional Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

### Navigation/Breadcrumb Display (Date & Time at the top of the page) (Resolves [#536](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/536) & [#538](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/538))
Adjustments were made to ensure that the users timezone (guest or authenticated) doesn't impact what's displayed on the registration page. It will only reflect the timezone reflected as part of the instance. No adjustments need be made to the Guest Users as the Guest Users should be in Greenwich Mean Time. This update also solves for when the event closes. The event registration should close based on the timezone of the instance.

### Registrant Skips Submit Page if there are ONLY Custom Questions (Resolved [#540](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/540))
Adjustments were made to ensure that an individual registering who was asked additional questions, using the Custom Question object, did not go to the Submit Page. This was creating an extra click and confusion as there was nothing to verify. So moving forward, if an individual is registering themselves, offered a custom question, when they complete the page, it'll submit the registration, which is the expectation.

### Bulk Transaction Emails Limit Managed (Resolves [#542](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/542))
When users trying to mass update registration and there is an email assocaited to the matching status/substatus, particularly from a list view, anything more than 10 emails causing a "Too many API email invocations" error. This was solved by "Bulkifying" the email message into a list to send with one "sendmail". Users should now be able to change the status on a list view and have the associated email sent without error.

### Summit Events Calendar Displays in Experience Cloud (Resolves [#543](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/543))
The Summit Events full calendar wasn't enabled to display within an Experience Cloud page, for guests or authenticated users. Adjustments were made and admins can use the Visualforce Page component on an Experience Cloud site, select "Summit Events" and have the calendar display, similar to how it might on a website.
> Note: The way it displays in the Builder or in Preview (as Guest or Authenticated User) is not how it will display on a published site. This is a known issue. Users should validate the calendar is working on a Published Experience Site from the perspective of the guest or logged in user, not the preview.

### Mobile Calendar View - Instances Clickable (Resolves [#544](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/544))
On the Summit Events full calendar, when on a mobile device or any adjustment to a smaller screen, the instances would display, but they were not clickable, stopping an individual from registering. This has been updated so all instances that are open are clickable, allowing a viewer to click and register.

## Technical Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

### Admin Only Install
During the installation process, users noticed that it was installing for all users and not just limiting to Admins when installing via [MetaDeploy](https://install.salesforce.org/products/SummitEventsApp/latest). Through MetaDeploy, users are not given the traditional option on who to install for, so a task in the .yml file was added to ensure that the application installs for Admins Only.

### Timezone Alignment to Instance Timezone designation (Resolves [#521](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/521))
Adjustments were made to account for the difference in Standard Time and Daylight Savings Time, capturing the appropriate adjustment for when the event is taking place in the future, rather than adjusting once the clocks change. This should reduce confusion, particularly with events that overlap with the time changes or in areas not effected by daylight savings.

### Relabeled "Preferred First Name Formatted (Resolves [#531](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/531))
Change the label of Preferred FIrst Name Formatted to "Preferred Full Name Formatted" on the Summit Event Registration Object as there was confusion on what should display. This is a formula field and users were expecting to see the same value as "Registrant Preferred First Name", but the formula captured either the Registration First Name or Preferred First Name as well as the Last Name.

### Midnight Displays as 12 (Resolves [#537](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/537))
If there were to be an event that started at midnight, the navigation/breadcrumb was displaying at 00.  This has been resolved to reflect 12:00 AM.
