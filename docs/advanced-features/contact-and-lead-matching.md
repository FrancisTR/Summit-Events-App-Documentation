# Contact and Lead Matching

Registration information is always stored in the Registration object.  Optionally, you can also attach registration information to a Contact or Lead or create a new Contact or Lead if needed.  When associating registrations to Contact or Lead record, you'll want to setup the Contact and Lead Matching information on your Summit Event.  Use the Table of Content links below to explore how to setup Contact or Lead matching.


*Note: This is optional functionality and not required for Summit Events to function.  If your organization does not want to match Summit Events Registration records with Contacts or Leads then this information does not apply.* 
**IMPORTANT: Currently Summit Events contact matching feature DOES NOT support person accounts.  If your instance uses person accounts, do not enable contact matching.  Person accounts will be addressed in a future release.**
