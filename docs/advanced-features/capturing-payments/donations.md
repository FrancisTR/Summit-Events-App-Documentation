Many events have a fundraising component and asking for a donation during the registration process is the best place to solicit and receive payment for one or more funds.   Suggested donation amounts are configurable per event instance so registrants have a better idea of the size of gift that would be appropriate.  The selected donation amount will be included in the event fee summary page.
