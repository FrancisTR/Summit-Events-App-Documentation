Many events have a fundraising component and asking for a donation during the registration process is the best place to solicit and receive payment for one or more funds.   Suggested donation amounts are configurable per event so registrants have a better idea of the size of gift that would be appropriate.  Up to 5 different donation allocations can be configured.   The selected donation amount will be included on the event fee summary page.
