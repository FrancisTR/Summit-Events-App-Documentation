# Registrant and Guest Questions
Summit Events comes with standard questions that can be asked during the registration process.  These fields have specific preconfigured field types (e.g. text, picklist, etc.).   The standard questions are configured on the Summit Events event pages.  You can select which ones you want to display, if the field should be required, you can even change the label of the question.    These may be all that is needed for most of your events.  If you have more advanced needs, Summit Events also provides the ability to create your own custom questions. 

# Standard Questions
Standard questions are predefined questions that can be enabled to show during the registration process.   The fields default to Do not ask, meaning they will not display.  By selecting Ask from the drop-down, the question will display on the registration page.  If the field should be required, select Ask and require.  The label of the question can also be changed if needed.   Standard questions appear on the first page of the registration process.
